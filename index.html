                            <p class ="dis_kpop_par"> In high school, I came across a Youtube video called <i>Teens React To Exo - Call Me Baby (K-pop)</i>. The teens had a positive reaction to the song which got me 
                                                    interested in watching the MV myself. I had never seen a genre of music that 
                                                    made the choreography an essential part of a song and so <span id = "dots">...</span>
                                                    <span id = "moreTxt">watching these 12 guys dancing so in sync with each 
                                                    other was a pretty cool thing to discover. On top of that the music seemed very
                                                    different than what I was used to with American genres. As you can imagine, I started
                                                    watching and searching for Exo's other songs and fell into a deep hole of obsession. 
                                                    But it wasn't only their songs that was so attention grabbing; I later found that they 
                                                    had really fun and diverse personalities while watching their live Korean TV specials. Pretty 
                                                    soon I became a true fan, waiting for their upcoming new song releases every few months called
                                                    "comebacks" and squealing from excitement whenever my favorite member came on screen. 
                                                    Don't laugh, I was only 15. Mind you, I had never really cared about any American boy 
                                                    band before, so me getting all excited over a Korean boy group 
                                                    was out of my character. I've been a fan of EXO and many other kpop groups ever since.</span> </p>

                            <p> After discovering kpop, I have had the priviledge of attending many concerts with my friends. Even my friends who weren't super fans found them exciting and unique. Although it was hard to get tickets sometimes, we still managed to attend our favorites even if they were back seat tickets. My favorite will always be my first Exo concert that I attended when I was in high school in 2017.    </p>
